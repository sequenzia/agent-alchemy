  "description": "Create the research agent at `claude/port-tools/agents/researcher.md` that performs live platform documentation research before each conversion session.\n\nThe agent should:\n- Be a Sonnet-tier agent (broad research task, parallelizable)\n- Have access to: WebSearch, WebFetch, context7 MCP tools (mcp__context7__resolve-library-id, mcp__context7__query-docs), Read, Glob, Grep\n- Accept a target platform name as input\n- Research the target platform's plugin/extension system thoroughly:\n  1. Fetch official documentation for the platform's plugin system\n  2. Search for community examples, GitHub repos, and blog posts\n  3. Analyze existing plugins on the target platform for conventions\n  4. Compare findings against the existing adapter file (if any)\n- Return structured findings as a \"platform profile\":\n  - Supported features list\n  - File format details\n  - Tool equivalents discovered\n  - Composition patterns\n  - Known limitations\n  - Confidence level per finding (high/medium/low)\n  - Sources for each finding\n\nFollow the pattern of existing Agent Alchemy agents (see `claude/core-tools/agents/code-explorer.md` for format reference).\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n_Functional:_\n- [ ] Agent markdown file follows Agent Alchemy agent conventions (YAML frontmatter + markdown body)\n- [ ] Frontmatter includes: name, description, model (sonnet), tools list\n- [ ] System prompt instructs comprehensive platform research workflow\n- [ ] Output format is structured as a platform profile with all required sections\n- [ ] Agent uses WebSearch, WebFetch, and context7 tools for research\n\n_Edge Cases:_\n- [ ] Handles case where platform has minimal documentation (reports low confidence)\n- [ ] Handles conflicting information between sources (presents both, notes conflict)\n- [ ] Handles research timeout gracefully (returns partial findings)\n\n_Error Handling:_\n- [ ] Fails gracefully if web search returns no results\n- [ ] Reports confidence level for each finding to help conversion decisions\n\n**Testing Requirements:**\n\u2022 Manual: Verify agent file validates against agent frontmatter schema\n\u2022 Manual: Test agent can be spawned via Task tool and returns structured findings\n\nSource: internal/specs/plugin-porting-SPEC.md Section 5.3, 9.1",
