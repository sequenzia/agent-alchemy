  "description": "Research OpenCode's plugin/extension architecture and create the first adapter file at `claude/port-tools/skills/plugin-porter/references/adapters/opencode.md`.\n\nResearch workflow:\n1. Use WebSearch and WebFetch to find OpenCode's official documentation on its plugin/extension system\n2. Search for community examples, GitHub repos, and blog posts about building OpenCode plugins/extensions\n3. Analyze existing OpenCode plugins for conventions and patterns\n4. Use context7 MCP tools if OpenCode documentation is available there\n\nCreate the adapter file following the format defined in the adapter format specification, filling in all sections:\n- Platform name: OpenCode, with current version\n- Directory structure for OpenCode plugins\n- Tool name mappings (Claude Code \u2192 OpenCode equivalents)\n- Model tier mappings\n- Frontmatter translations\n- Hook/lifecycle event mappings\n- Composition mechanism\n- Path resolution mechanism\n- Adapter version\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n_Functional:_\n- [ ] Adapter file follows the defined adapter format specification exactly\n- [ ] All mapping sections populated with researched data from OpenCode's docs\n- [ ] Tool mapping covers all Claude Code tools with OpenCode equivalents or `null` markers\n- [ ] Model mapping identifies OpenCode's model configuration approach\n- [ ] Composition mechanism documents how OpenCode handles multi-file plugin structures\n- [ ] Path resolution documents OpenCode's equivalent of `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`\n\n_Edge Cases:_\n- [ ] Documents features with no OpenCode equivalent (marked as `null` with explanation)\n- [ ] Notes any OpenCode features that have no Claude Code equivalent (for gap awareness)\n- [ ] Handles case where OpenCode documentation is sparse \u2014 document confidence levels\n\n_Error Handling:_\n- [ ] Includes notes on research sources and confidence for each mapping\n- [ ] Flags any mappings that are uncertain or based on community examples rather than official docs\n\n**Testing Requirements:**\n\u2022 Manual: Cross-check adapter mappings against OpenCode's current documentation\n\u2022 Manual: Verify adapter file is parseable following the adapter format spec\n\nSource: internal/specs/plugin-porting-SPEC.md Section 5.8, 9.1",
