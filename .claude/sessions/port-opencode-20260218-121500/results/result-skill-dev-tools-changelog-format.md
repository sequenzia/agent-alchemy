# Keep a Changelog Format

This skill provides guidelines for writing and formatting changelogs following the [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) specification.

## Core Principles

1. **Changelogs are for humans** - Write for users, not machines
2. **Every version gets a section** - Including `[Unreleased]` for upcoming changes
3. **Changes are grouped by type** - Consistent categorization
4. **Versions are linkable** - Each version header links to comparison
5. **Latest version comes first** - Reverse chronological order
6. **Release dates are shown** - ISO format: YYYY-MM-DD

## Change Categories

Use these categories in this order:

| Category | Description | When to Use |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Added** | New features | New functionality users can now do |
| **Changed** | Changes in existing functionality | Behavior modifications, improvements |
| **Deprecated** | Soon-to-be removed features | Features marked for future removal |
| **Removed** | Removed features | Features that no longer exist |
| **Fixed** | Bug fixes | Corrections to existing functionality |
| **Security** | Security vulnerability fixes | Security-related changes |

### Category Guidelines

**Added**
- New user-facing features
- New API endpoints
- New configuration options
- New integrations

**Changed**
- Performance improvements
- UX/UI changes
- Default value changes
- Behavior modifications

**Deprecated**
- Features planned for removal
- APIs being replaced
- Include migration path when possible

**Removed**
- Breaking changes (removed functionality)
- Deleted APIs or features
- Always note what replaced it (if applicable)

**Fixed**
- Bug corrections
- Error handling improvements
- Edge case fixes

**Security**
- Vulnerability patches
- Security-related fixes
- Always include CVE if available

## Entry Writing Guidelines

### Use Imperative Mood

Start entries with imperative verbs:

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Add support for... | Added support for... |
| Fix crash when... | Fixed a crash that occurred when... |
| Remove deprecated... | Removed the deprecated... |
| Change default to... | Changed the default to... |

### Focus on User Impact

Write from the user's perspective:

| Good (User-focused) | Bad (Implementation-focused) |
|---------------------|------------------------------|
| Add dark mode toggle | Implement ThemeProvider context |
| Fix login failing silently | Add try-catch to auth handler |
| Speed up page load by 40% | Optimize database queries |

### Be Specific and Concise

| Good (Specific) | Bad (Vague) |
|-----------------|-------------|
| Fix crash when uploading files over 10MB | Fix upload bug |
| Add CSV export for transaction history | Add export feature |
| Change session timeout from 30 to 60 minutes | Update session settings |

### Include Context When Helpful

Use parenthetical context for clarity:

```markdown
- Add OAuth2 support (Google, GitHub)
- Fix timezone handling (UTC offset calculation)
- Change rate limit (100 → 500 requests/minute)
```

## Changelog Structure

```markdown
# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- New entries go here

## [1.0.0] - 2024-01-15

### Added
- Initial public release
- Feature A with description
- Feature B with description

### Changed
- Improvement to existing feature

### Fixed
- Bug fix description

## [0.9.0] - 2024-01-01

### Added
- Beta release features

[Unreleased]: https://github.com/owner/repo/compare/v1.0.0...HEAD
[1.0.0]: https://github.com/owner/repo/compare/v0.9.0...v1.0.0
[0.9.0]: https://github.com/owner/repo/releases/tag/v0.9.0
```

## Semantic Versioning Connection

Changelog categories map to version bumps:

| Category | Version Impact |
|----------|----------------|
| Removed (after v1.0) | MAJOR bump |
| Removed (before v1.0) | MINOR bump |
| Added, Changed | MINOR bump |
| Deprecated, Fixed, Security | PATCH bump |

## What NOT to Include

- Internal refactoring (unless it affects users)
- Dependency updates (unless they affect functionality)
- Test changes
- CI/CD changes
- Documentation-only changes (unless user-facing docs)
- Code style/formatting changes

---

## Entry Examples Reference

<!-- Inlined from references/entry-examples.md (opencode has no reference_dir; content inlined directly) -->

### Added Category

#### Good Examples

```markdown
- Add user authentication with email/password and OAuth (Google, GitHub)

- Add keyboard shortcuts for common actions (Ctrl+S to save, Ctrl+Z to undo)
- Add dark mode with automatic system preference detection
- Add webhook support for order status changes
- Add rate limiting (100 requests/minute per API key)
```

#### Poor Examples (with corrections)

| Poor Entry | Why It's Poor | Better Version |
|------------|---------------|----------------|
| `Added new feature` | Too vague, no information | `Add invoice PDF generation` |
| `Implemented AuthService class` | Implementation detail, not user-facing | `Add user authentication` |
| `Added support for thing` | Unclear what "thing" is | `Add support for WebP image uploads` |
| `New button` | No context, incomplete | `Add "Export All" button to dashboard` |

---

- Increase file upload limit from 5MB to 25MB
```

#### Poor Examples (with corrections)

| Poor Entry | Why It's Poor | Better Version |
|------------|---------------|----------------|
| `Refactored code` | Internal detail, no user impact | (Omit, or) `Improve page load speed by 40%` |
| `Updated dependencies` | Internal maintenance | (Omit unless user-facing change) |
| `Changed stuff` | Completely uninformative | `Change notification preferences to opt-in` |
| `Made improvements` | Too vague | `Improve error messages with specific guidance` |

---

```

#### Poor Examples (with corrections)

| Poor Entry | Why It's Poor | Better Version |
|------------|---------------|----------------|
| `Fixed bug` | No description of what was fixed | `Fix duplicate orders created on retry` |
| `Bug fix` | Even less information | `Fix search returning stale results` |
| `Fixed issue #123` | Requires looking up issue | `Fix CSV export missing header row (#123)` |
| `Fixed null pointer exception in UserService.java:42` | Too technical | `Fix crash when viewing deleted user profile` |

| `Deleted files` | Meaningless to users | (Omit if internal) |
| `Removed feature` | Which feature? | `Remove email digest option` |

---

- Add user profile customization
  - Profile picture upload
  - Bio and social links
  - Custom theme colors

#### Good Examples

```markdown
- Add GraphQL API alongside existing REST API
- Add WebSocket support for real-time updates (replaces polling)
- Fix N+1 query issue causing slow dashboard load
- Change database connection pooling (improves concurrent user handling)
```

#### Avoid Over-Technical Entries

## Fidelity Report

| Mapping Type | Count | Weight | Contribution |
|-------------|-------|--------|-------------|
| Direct | 2 | 1.0 | 2.0 |
| Workaround | 2 | 0.7 | 1.4 |
| TODO | 0 | 0.2 | 0.0 |
| Omitted | 1 | 0.0 | 0.0 |
| **Total** | **5** | | **3.4** |

**Notes:** Score = 3.4 / 5 * 100 = 68%. The two workarounds are: (1) `name` field relocated to filename as per opencode convention, and (2) `references/entry-examples.md` inlined into the skill body because opencode has no `reference_dir` support. The `disable-model-invocation` field was omitted as it has no opencode equivalent and is cosmetic in impact (opencode always makes skills available to the model).

## Decisions

| Feature | Decision Type | Original | Converted | Rationale | Confidence | Resolution Mode |
|---------|-------------|----------|-----------|-----------|------------|----------------|
| `name` field | relocated | `name: changelog-format` | Filename: `changelog-format.md` | Skill frontmatter mapping: `name` -> `embedded:filename`. opencode derives skill name from the containing filename. | high | auto |
| `description` field | direct | `description: Keep a Changelog format guidelines...` | `description: Keep a Changelog format guidelines...` | Direct 1:1 mapping. Field name and value preserved unchanged. | high | N/A |
| `user-invocable` field | direct | `user-invocable: false` | `user-invocable: false` | Direct 1:1 mapping. Field name and boolean value preserved. | high | N/A |
| `disable-model-invocation` field | omitted | `disable-model-invocation: false` | (removed) | Maps to `null` in opencode. opencode always makes skills available to the model; this restriction has no equivalent. Severity is cosmetic because the source value is `false` (feature was disabled, so removing it changes nothing functionally). | high | auto |
| `references/entry-examples.md` reference | workaround (flattened) | `- \`references/entry-examples.md\` - Examples of well-written vs poorly-written entries` | Content inlined as "Entry Examples Reference" section | opencode `reference_dir` maps to `null`. Reference files cannot be loaded separately; content must be inlined. Full content of `references/entry-examples.md` inlined under a new section heading. Prose pointer removed and replaced with the actual content. | medium | auto |

## Gaps

| Feature | Reason | Severity | Workaround | User Acknowledged |
|---------|--------|----------|------------|-------------------|
| `disable-model-invocation` field | opencode has no per-skill model invocation restriction. Skills are always available to the model. | cosmetic | Field omitted. Source value was `false` (restriction was not active), so no functional change. | false |
| `references/entry-examples.md` reference file | opencode has no `reference_dir` concept. Reference files cannot be distributed alongside skills as separate loadable documents. | functional | Full content of `references/entry-examples.md` inlined directly into the skill body under an "Entry Examples Reference" section. No content lost. | false |

## Unresolved Incompatibilities

Incompatibilities the converter agent could not auto-resolve. The orchestrator batches these between waves.
