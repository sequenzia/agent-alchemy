# Execute Tasks Skill

This skill orchestrates autonomous task execution for Claude Code Tasks. It builds a dependency-aware execution plan, launches a dedicated agent for each task through a 4-phase workflow (Understand, Implement, Verify, Complete), handles retries with failure context, and shares learnings across tasks through a shared execution context file.

## Core Principles

### 1. Understand Before Implementing

Never write code without first understanding:
- What the task requires (acceptance criteria or inferred requirements)
- What code already exists (read before modify)
- What conventions the project follows (CLAUDE.md, existing patterns)
- What earlier tasks discovered (shared execution context)

### 2. Follow Existing Patterns

Match the codebase's established patterns:
- Coding style, naming conventions, file organization
- Error handling approach, logging patterns
- Test framework, test structure, assertion style
- Import ordering, module organization

### 3. Verify Against Criteria

Do not assume implementation is correct. Verify by:
- Walking through each acceptance criterion for spec-generated tasks
- Running tests and linters for all tasks
- Confirming the core change works as intended
- Checking for regressions in existing functionality

### 4. Report Honestly

Produce accurate verification results:
- PASS only when all Functional criteria pass and tests pass
- PARTIAL when non-critical criteria fail but core works
- FAIL when Functional criteria or tests fail
- Never mark a task complete if verification fails

## Orchestration Workflow

This skill orchestrates task execution through an 8-step loop. See `references/orchestration.md` for the full detailed procedure.

### Step 1: Load Task List
Retrieve all tasks via `TaskList`. If a specific `task-id` argument was provided, validate it exists.

### Step 2: Validate State
Handle edge cases: empty list, all completed, specific task blocked, no unblocked tasks, circular dependencies.

### Step 3: Build Execution Plan
Collect unblocked pending tasks, sort by priority (critical > high > medium > low > unprioritized), break ties by "unblocks most others."

### Step 4: Check Settings
Read `.claude/sdd-tools.local.md` if it exists for execution preferences.

### Step 5: Present Execution Plan
Display the plan showing tasks to execute, blocked tasks, and completed count. Informational only, no confirmation needed.

### Step 6: Initialize Execution Context
Create `.claude/execution-context.md` if it doesn't exist with sections for Project Patterns, Key Decisions, Known Issues, File Map, and Task History. If it exists, read it for prior session context.

### Step 7: Execute Loop
For each task: get details, mark in progress, launch `sdd-tools:task-executor` agent, process result (PASS/PARTIAL/FAIL), handle retries, refresh task list for newly unblocked tasks.

### Step 8: Session Summary
Display execution results with pass/fail counts, failed task list, and newly unblocked tasks.

## Task Classification

Determine whether a task is spec-generated or general to select the right verification approach.

### Detection Algorithm

1. **Check description format**: Look for `**Acceptance Criteria:**` with categorized criteria (`_Functional:_`, `_Edge Cases:_`, etc.)
2. **Check metadata**: Look for `metadata.prd_path` field
3. **Check source reference**: Look for `Source: {path} Section {number}` in the description

If any check matches -> **spec-generated task** (use criterion-based verification)

If none match -> **General task** (use inferred verification)

## 4-Phase Workflow

Each task is executed by the `sdd-tools:task-executor` agent through these phases:

### Phase 1: Understand

Load context and understand scope before writing code.

- Read the execute-tasks skill and references
- Read `.claude/execution-context.md` for learnings from prior tasks
- Load task details via `TaskGet`
- Classify the task (spec-generated vs general)
- Parse acceptance criteria or infer requirements from description
- Explore affected files via Glob/Grep
- Read `CLAUDE.md` for project conventions

### Phase 2: Implement

Execute the code changes following project patterns.

- Read all target files before modifying them
- Follow the project's implementation order (data -> service -> interface -> tests)
- Match existing coding patterns and conventions
- Write tests if specified in testing requirements
- Run mid-implementation checks (linter, existing tests) to catch issues early

### Phase 3: Verify

Verify implementation against task requirements using the adaptive approach.

- **spec-generated tasks**: Walk each acceptance criteria category (Functional, Edge Cases, Error Handling, Performance), check testing requirements, run tests
- **General tasks**: Infer "done" from description, run existing tests, run linter, verify core change is implemented

### Phase 4: Complete

Report results and share learnings.

- Determine status (PASS/PARTIAL/FAIL) based on verification results
- If PASS: mark task as `completed` via `TaskUpdate`
- If PARTIAL or FAIL: leave as `in_progress` for the orchestrator to decide on retry
- Append learnings to `.claude/execution-context.md` (files discovered, patterns learned, issues encountered)
- Return structured report with verification results

## Adaptive Verification Overview

Verification adapts based on task type:

| Task Type | Verification Method | Pass Threshold |
|-----------|-------------------|----------------|
| spec-generated | Criterion-by-criterion evaluation | All Functional + Tests must pass |
| General | Inferred checklist from description | Core change works + Tests pass |

**Critical rule**: All Functional criteria must pass for a PASS result. Edge Cases, Error Handling, and Performance failures result in PARTIAL but do not block completion.

## Shared Execution Context

Tasks within an execution session share learnings through `.claude/execution-context.md`:

- **Read at start**: Check for prior task learnings before beginning work
- **Write at end**: Always append learnings regardless of PASS/PARTIAL/FAIL
- **Sections**: Project Patterns, Key Decisions, Known Issues, File Map, Task History

This enables later tasks to benefit from earlier discoveries and retry attempts to learn from previous failures.

## Key Behaviors

- **Fully autonomous**: No user prompts between tasks. The loop runs without interruption.
- **One agent per task**: Each task gets a fresh agent invocation with isolated context.
- **Configurable retries**: Default 3 attempts per task, configurable via `retries` argument.
- **Retry with context**: Each retry includes the previous attempt's failure details so the agent can try a different approach.
- **Dynamic unblocking**: After each task completes, the dependency graph is refreshed and newly unblocked tasks are added to the plan.
- **Honest failure handling**: After retries exhausted, tasks stay `in_progress` (not completed), and execution continues to the next task.
- **Circular dependency detection**: If all remaining tasks are blocked by each other, break at the weakest link (task with fewest blockers) and log a warning.
- **Shared context**: Agents read and write `.claude/execution-context.md` so later tasks benefit from earlier discoveries.

## Example Usage

### Execute all unblocked tasks
```
/sdd-tools:execute-tasks
```

### Execute a specific task
```
/sdd-tools:execute-tasks 5
```

### Execute with custom retry limit
```
/sdd-tools:execute-tasks --retries 1
```

### Execute specific task with retries
```
/sdd-tools:execute-tasks 5 --retries 5
```
