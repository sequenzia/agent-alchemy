Spec-Driven Development (SDD) Tools provides a complete pipeline for turning ideas into working code through structured specifications. Create specs via an adaptive interview process, analyze them for quality issues, and decompose them into dependency-ordered tasks with acceptance criteria. Tasks execute autonomously in waves — each task runs in its own subagent with an isolated context window, while shared knowledge propagates between tasks through filesystem-based context files. Supports intelligent task merging for iterative spec updates, configurable parallelism, and automatic session recovery.
