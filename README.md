## Task Manager

**See your Claude Code Tasks in real-time.**

The Task Manager is a real-time Kanban board that visualizes Claude's native task system (`~/.claude/tasks/`). Watch tasks flow from Pending → In Progress → Completed as Claude works through your project.

**Key Features:**
- **Real-time updates** — Tasks update instantly via Server-Sent Events as Claude works
- **Dependency tracking** — See which tasks block others and track completion flow
- **Statistics dashboard** — Monitor progress with completion percentages and blocked task counts
- **Search & filter** — Quickly find tasks across large task lists
- **Dark/light themes** — Easy on the eyes during those long coding sessions

```bash
cd claude-apps/task-manager
pnpm install && pnpm dev  # Starts on http://localhost:3030
```
