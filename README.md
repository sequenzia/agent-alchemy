# Claude Alchemy

**Supercharge your Claude Code workflow with powerful plugins and a visual task manager.**

Claude Alchemy is a collection of tools and applications designed to help developers get the most out of [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code).

## Task Manager

**See your Claude Code Tasks in real-time.**

The Task Manager is a real-time Kanban board that visualizes Claude's native task system (`~/.claude/tasks/`). Watch tasks flow from Pending → In Progress → Completed as Claude works through your project.

- **Statistics dashboard** — Monitor progress with completion percentages and blocked task counts
- **Search & filter** — Quickly find tasks across large task lists
- **Dark/light themes** — Easy on the eyes during those long coding sessions
